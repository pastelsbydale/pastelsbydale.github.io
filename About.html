            <p id="about">
                Dale A. Lewis was a painter by trade. A graduate of Wayne State University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1966, Dale’s favorite subject was animals, and he ran a business making pastels of pets on commission from his home in Delray Beach, FL.
                While he largely quit doing commissions in early 2018, he continued creating other artwork, even basing some of his drawings off photos from the Library of Congress. Dale passed away in November of 2018.  This site contains the work that Dale left behind when he passed away.
                His nephew, Gregg, would like to ensure these beautiful pieces are enjoyed and that Dale's passion may continue to live on.
